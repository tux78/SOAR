# Security Orchestration, Automation and Response 
This repository provides a docker-based installation of MISP and intelMQ. Using this, a fully operational installation can be set up within just a few steps

## Create working directory
As a first step it is recommended to create a working directory
```
# mkdir SOAR
# cd SOAR
```

## Clone repository
Cloning the repository is done by running the following command
```
# git clone https://github.com/tux78/SOAR.git
```

## Execute setup routine
The actual setup is initiated by executing the setup routine
```
# ./setup
```

The following setup will ask some questions:
- Install MISP
- Install intelMQ
- Integrate intelMQ with ePO (requires ePO IP, username and password)

Please note that especially the MISP setup requires some time. Depending on resources this can take up to 1/2 hour!

## intelMQ Development
Development of additinal intelMQ Bots takes place in the following directory on the docker host itself:
```
# cd ./dev_intelmq/intelmq/bots
```
Bots are located in the corresponding directories:
- collectors
- parsers
- experts
- outputs

Keep in mind that additional (new) bots have to be added to the following file as well;
```
# vi ./dev_intelmq/intelmq/bots/BOTS
```
In order to apply any changes to the running environment, the following command can be executed:
```
# ./docker-compose exec intelmq /update_dev.sh
```
